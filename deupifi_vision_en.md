## 1. Foreword

In the coming years, the European Union is building a unified digital infrastructure for payments and identity. By the end of 2026, every EU citizen and business will have access to a digital identity wallet under the eIDAS regulation. At the same time, the **Digital Euro** is being developed: the European Central Bank aims to complete the legislative framework before mid-2026, paving the way for a potential rollout shortly after. These initiatives will reshape financial interaction across Europe. Deupifi is designed from the ground up to align with this new ecosystem – a multilingual, AI-driven personal CFO that integrates seamlessly with both the Digital Euro and the EU’s digital identity framework.

## 2. Vision and Mission

Deupifi’s mission is to make the “CFO mindset” accessible to everyone. The app continuously analyzes income, spending, and goals, providing real-time, personalized financial guidance—from budgeting to investment optimization. Its core values are simplicity, transparency, and privacy. Artificial intelligence plays a central role: AI democratizes financial expertise that was once reserved for corporations, giving every consumer access to insights once only available to professional CFOs. Deupifi becomes that personal CFO—proactive, personalized, and always available.

**Key features:**
- **Proactive Budgeting and Forecasting:** Predicts income and expenses and warns users of shortfalls or overspending trends.
- **Savings and Investment Optimization:** Recommends personalized saving and investment strategies to maximize returns.
- **Real-Time Insights:** Intuitive dashboards for clear overviews of cash flow, goals, and forecasts.
- **Data Integration:** Secure connections to banks via PSD2/Open Banking with multilingual UX and full GDPR/eIDAS compliance.
- **Smart Notifications:** Context-aware alerts for savings, renewals, and spending anomalies.
- **Virtual CFO Assistant:** Conversational AI that provides tailored, human-like financial advice.

## 3. Market Analysis

The European personal finance market is advanced but fragmented. Traditional banks retain customers well but are struggling to acquire new ones, while neobanks and fintech apps are rapidly expanding. For instance, neobanks in France are gaining customers at nearly twice the rate of traditional banks. Specialized finance apps—money transfer, savings, and investment tools—are also on the rise, though the investment app sector remains volatile, especially around cryptocurrencies. Analysts agree that future winners will combine the retention strength of banks with the innovation and digital acquisition strategies of fintech startups.

**Key trends:**
- Growing **user mobility** and 24/7 access are establishing the digital wallet as the standard.
- **Cross-border functionality:** EU citizens expect seamless service across national and currency boundaries.
- **AI and automation** are transforming financial management, shifting from passive tracking to proactive advisory tools.
- **Security and compliance:** Younger users expect fintechs to be as safe as banks, but with far better user experience.

## 4. Technological Ecosystem (Digital Euro & eIDAS)

Deupifi fits perfectly into the rapidly evolving European digital framework. Through the eIDAS regulation, the app can use EU-recognized trust services for secure identification and document exchange. Users will be able to authenticate themselves or share verified financial documents with institutions using their EU Digital Identity Wallet. As for the Digital Euro, simplicity and reliability are key: surveys show that consumers value ease of use, low fees, and broad accessibility—including offline transactions—for any new payment method. Deupifi anticipates this by integrating native payment functionality, including potential Digital Euro support, ensuring all transactions follow EU-certified security standards. This positions Deupifi as both a financial and trust layer that works seamlessly across borders.

## 6. Business Model and Strategy

Deupifi follows a hybrid business model. The base app will be free, ensuring mass adoption, while premium features (advanced analytics, AI financial coaching, API access) will be subscription-based. In parallel, **B2B licensing and partnerships** with banks, insurers, and accounting firms will create additional revenue streams. These institutions can use Deupifi as a white-label platform or purchase anonymized data analytics for insights.

**Strategic pillars:**
- **Phased EU rollout:** Launch first in the Netherlands, then scale across key EU markets using the eIDAS infrastructure.
- **Regulatory compliance as an advantage:** Stay ahead of PSD3, Digital Euro, and data governance regulations.
- **Partnership-driven growth:** Collaborate with fintech networks, EU digital initiatives, and corporate partners to expand reach.
- **Market potential:** The European fintech sector continues to grow. For example, the UK-based AI saving app **Cleo** reached over 6 million users and €136 million in revenue by 2024, proving that AI-driven finance apps can be both impactful and profitable.
